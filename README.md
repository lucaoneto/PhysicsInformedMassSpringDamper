# PhisicsInformedMassSpringDamper

In this repository, you can find the code of the illustrative example proposed in the paper "A Review on Full-, Zero-, and Partial-Knowledge based Predictive Models for Industrial Applications".
A mass-spring-damper system with no external force applied is studied.

Assume we have the capability to measure the displacement u(t) of the mass at various moments in time t ∈ [0, tm]. 
The scope is to predict the mass’s position at any given time (both in the past, t ∈ [0, tm], and in the future t ∈ (tm, tf ]). 
We compared three ways to achive the target: 1)FKPM, 2)ZKPM, and 3)PKPM.
